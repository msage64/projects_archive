Objective:
    Create a robotic hand that would be programmed to create basic ASL sign configurations. Current signs include, but are not limited to:
 rock on, fist, hangloose, ILY and counting 1-9. 
 
 Learning Outcome: 
    Learned Git and GitHub
    Became a beginner at C (I read a book on it and turns out the C files were all jacked up, so I ended up programming it in python)
    Learned Python-All my scripts and modules are in python for this project
    Learned Bash and the Linux command line
    lear ned how to do a fresh install of Ubuntu on a RPi
    Learned and became versed in the RPi and ARM architecture 
    Learned about Linux file systems and file management
    Learned about SSH and how to establish one over a network
    Learned about the protocols and how i2c works at the machine code level
    Learned what a PATH variable was and how to set it
    Learned how to use WinSCP
    Learned how to use Putty
    Dabbled in wireless communication protocols and infrastructure. 
    I knew how to 3D-print.. but there was A LOT of it!
    I read about 120 pages of Python Crash course ISBN-13: 978-1593276034
    I read about 100 pages of Learning robotic using python ISBN-13: 978-1783287536
    I read about 200 pages of GNU/Linux Rapid Embedded Programming ISBN-13: 978-1786461803
    I read a lot of C Programming Language, 2nd Edition  ISBN-13: 978-0131103627
 
 Functionallity:
   This was programmed using 300 lines of Python. I wrote a script on my local device, sent the script to the Raspberry Pi via an SSH and MinGW. Executing
   the code on the RPi through a terminal over my network initiates the RPi to send serial data via I2C to a 16 ch. Adafruit servo driver. This servo driver 
   controls the 6 servos that are linked to the robotic hands tendons. The entire robotic hand is 3D printed and based off the open source designs by InMoov. 
 I currently have it fully controlled wirelessly over my network through SSH. After executing the python script through terminal, it waits for user input.
The currently available commands are:
'help' -brings up help menu with list of commands
'quit'- exits user input state
'fist'-contract all fingers and makes.... a fist
'hand_loose' - contracts all fingers, then extends pinky and thumb
'f_you' -pretty sure you can figure that one out..
